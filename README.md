This GitHub project represents my university coursework on ray tracing, a computer graphics technique for generating realistic images by simulating the way light interacts with objects. The project is focused on implementing a ray tracer, and the provided course materials include various supporting files. The two files in this repository are my contributions to the assignment, where I've specifically worked on the core functionalities of the ray tracer.
